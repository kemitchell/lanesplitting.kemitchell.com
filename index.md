## Split the far left lanes.

```
|   ↑   |   |   |
|   ↑   |   |   |
| 1 ↑ 2 | 3 | 4 |
|   ↑   |   |   |
|   ↑   |   |   |
```

## Go no more than ten miles per hour over.

Split at no more than 10 miles per hour faster than surrounding traffic.  If traffic does 10, do 20.  If traffic does 20, do 30.

## Don't split above 30 miles per hour.

At these speeds, your reaction time often won't be enough to avoid hazards.

## Beware of gaps.

When a car-length space opens in either lane ahead of you, beware of cars merging into the space.

## Don't split narrow lanes.

Some lanes are just too narrow to fit an automobile, a safety margin, a motorcycle, another safety margin, and another automobile abreast.

## Keep your hands on your controls.

Don't be tempted to take your hands off controls to wave or salute automobiles that make room for you.

## Use your high beams.

Enable your high beams when splitting in daylight.

## Watch out for turn signals.

When a car ahead of you flashes their turn signal in your direction, slow down or stop before passing them.  They may start moving in their lane, even if there's no space in the next lane for them to merge into.

## Check for other motorcycling before splitting.

Before leaving a lane to split, check behind for any motorcyclist already splitting that lane behind you.

## When splitting toward a stop, look out for panhandlers.

In heavy traffic, panhandlers may set up between lanes at stop signs and stop lights.
